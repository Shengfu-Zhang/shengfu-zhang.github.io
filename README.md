# Shengfu Zhang — Personal Blog

**Live site:** https://shengfu-zhang.github.io/shengfu-blog/

Writing about AI, engineering systems, and how the two are reshaping the way we build software.

## What this repo is

This is both a **personal site** and a **content archive**. Every post lives here in full — the long-form essay plus all platform variants (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, 小红书) — so nothing gets lost across platforms.

The site is static HTML hosted on GitHub Pages. No build step, no framework, no dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

## How new posts get made

1. Think through an idea in a conversation
2. AI agent reads `CLAUDE.md` and generates all platform variants + images
3. New folder lands in `posts/`, `index.html` gets updated
4. Push to `main` → site auto-updates via GitHub Pages
5. Manually cross-post to Substack / LinkedIn / X / 小红书 (no auto-publish)
